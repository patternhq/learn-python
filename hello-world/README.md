In this directory you'll find a "Hello World" example.  To run it,
simply execute it with python:

```
python /path/to/hello_world.py
```

You can look at the [code](hello_world.py).  Aside from the comments, it is only
one line long:

```py
print('Hello World')
```

There are 2 things here.  The first thing is a
[string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)
(`'Hello World'`) which is a python data structure that is used to represent
text.  The second thing is a function call:

```py
print(...)
```

Let's look at some of python's builtin types [next](../builtin-types/README.md).
