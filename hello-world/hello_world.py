"""It is customary in programming to start with a "Hello World" example.  These
examples usually just print something simple on the screen (like "Hello world").

The text at the top of this file is considered a "docstring" (which is a
special kind of comment in python).

As you can see, a hello world program in python is trivial (it only takes one
line of real code).
"""

# This is a normal comment.  It doesn't get executed or do anything.

print('Hello World!')  # Comments also can happen at the end of the line.

# In python3.x, `print` is a function which means that you need to call it.
# In python2.x, `print` is a "keyword".  You'd use it like this:
#
# print 'Hello World!'
