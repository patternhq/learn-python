This repository is for learning python (and maybe a little `git` while we're at
it)...

To get this repository, you can clone it:

```
cd <directory-you-like-to-keep-repos-in>
git clone https://github.com/patternhq/learn-python.git
```

If you've already cloned it in the past and are coming back to it after a
hiatus, just go to that directory and `git pull` to get the latest version.

This class is teaching python3.x (since it is the future of python).  For the
most part, there aren't significant differences between python3.x and python2.x
unless you actually need to migrate a large codebase from python2.x to
python3.x.  I'll try to at least mention when we talk about things that are
inconsistent between python2.x and python3.x.

First, lets get the environment set up using [anaconda](get-anaconda.md).
