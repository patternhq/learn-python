This repository is for learning python (and maybe a little `git` while we're at
it)...

To get this repository, you can clone it:

```
cd <directory-you-like-to-keep-repos-in>
git clone https://github.com/patternhq/learn-python.git
```

If you've already cloned it in the past and are coming back to it after a
hiatus, just go to that directory and `git pull` to get the latest version.
